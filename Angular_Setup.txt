Note :
Step : 1  Require VSC (Visual Studio Code) open source IDE for Project Development provided by Microsoft.
        https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Step 2:  Install Latest Node Version from  https://nodejs.org/en/download

          1:Asynchronous and Event-Driven : Event-driven architecture, allowing developers to respond to events and execute callbacks when operations complete.
          2:Single-threaded, Non-blocking I/O : Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop to handle multiple concurrent connections without the need for threads. 
                                                Well suited for build scalable & Application with high performance that uses concurrent connections.                
          3:NPM : Node js comes with NPM (It allows developer to easily manage & share third party library & tool),NPM is one of the largest ecosystem of open source libraries 
          3:Extensive Module System : Modular Architecture(Use of small reusable modules),Organizing & Structuring Code allow developer to add externa libraries
          4:Cross-Platform : Designed to run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux
          5 Used for Building Server-Side Applications : Web API, Web Server , Real Time Application
          Node.js comes with npm, a package manager that allows developers to easily manage and share third-party 
          libraries and tools. npm is one of the largest ecosystems of open-source libraries, making it easy to find and use 
         


Step 3: Note : Setup the Node_Module path in environment variable (To run js dependencies)
Step 4: Setup Github repository for better branching strategy
        1: git init
        2: git add README.md (git add .)//for multiple files
        3: git branch -M main
        4: git remote add origin https://github.com/vatsdebugzone/Angular_16_Todos.git

Step 5:  You can use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, 
         and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.
        
         npm install -g @angular/cli 

Step 6:   Create new angular app using angular cli command
          ng new app_name (e-todos)
           --> ASK for styling (select according to your comfortability)
                     -->CSS
                     -->SCSS Sassy Cascading Style Sheets : Super set fo CSS
                     -->SASS Special type of file for SCSS

           ---> ASK for SSG (Server side generation ) & SSR (Server side rendering)     
                  SSR : In SSR server sends fully rendered HTML to the client in case of each request
